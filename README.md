## 📖 Overview

**Pawsie Adventure (BoofWoof)** is a **3D First-Person Puzzle-Adventure Game** where players control Scruffy, a clever corgi trapped in a medieval castle. Using canine abilities like biting, barking, smelling, and sprinting, players must solve environmental puzzles, avoid the jealous Dobermann Rex, and escape the castle's treacherous halls.

This project was developed using a custom **Entity Component System (ECS) architecture**. This data-oriented approach ensures high performance and modularity, enabling the complex implementation of dog-specific mechanics—such as scent trails, dynamic barking interactions, and physics-based puzzle elements—without tight coupling.
